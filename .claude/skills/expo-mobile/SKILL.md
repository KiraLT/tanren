# Expo mobile for Tanren

Source of truth for the app's layout, store contract and commands:
`apps/mobile/CLAUDE.md`. Research: `docs/research/2026-10-20-expo-mobile.md`.
Official docs: https://docs.expo.dev/ (Router, SQLite, monorepos, web).

## Decided at step 6 (2026-10-20, gate green)

- Expo SDK 58 (`expo` 58.0.16, `expo-router` 58.0.24, `expo-sqlite`
  58.0.13, RN 0.88, React 19.3.0), pinned in the root `pnpm-workspace.yaml`
  catalog. Versions come from Expo's `bundledNativeModules.json`, not npm
  latest.
- pnpm **isolated** linker (the default; no `nodeLinker` in
  `pnpm-workspace.yaml`): Expo ≥ 54 resolves it without `watchFolders` or
  `extraNodeModules`. `metro.config.js` exists only to register the sqlite
  `.wasm` asset. ADR still to be written by the Lead.
- `apps/mobile/tsconfig.json` extends `expo/tsconfig.base.json` (the `.json`
  suffix is required) **and** `../../tsconfig.base.json` (last, so strict
  flags win). `experiments.typedRoutes: true` in `app.json`, else
  `expo start` rewrites the tsconfig; `expo-types.d.ts` is committed.
- Entry `"main": "expo-router/entry"`; routes `app/_layout.tsx`,
  `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx`, `app/(tabs)/{today,plan}.tsx`.
- Ids via `expo-crypto` `randomUUID` behind the `IdGenerator` service
  (`src/services/runtime.ts`; tests use `IdGenerator.layerTest`). Hermes
  `crypto.randomUUID` is unverified, so do not call it directly.
- Effect runs only in `src/services/` behind one `runtime`; components see
  `src/hooks/` only (`.claude/rules/react.md`).
- Tests: vitest with `node:sqlite` (Node 24) as the SqlDriver; expo-sqlite
  is the runtime layer. Package gate: `pnpm -F @tanren/mobile test` +
  `typecheck` + `biome ci apps/mobile`.
- Web sqlite (wasm) needs COEP `credentialless` + COOP `same-origin` from
  the host; the Worker must send them at deploy (step 7).
- Runtime proof is the `ui-check` skill (agent-browser) against
  `expo start --web --port <n>`; tests do not prove the UI.

## Not yet filled (step 7)

EAS Update / Expo Go publish flow · `expo export --platform web` served
from the Worker · two-column web layout.

## Vendor plugin skills

Mobile engineers load `expo:expo-overview` first, then `expo:expo-router`,
`expo:expo-native-ui`, `expo:expo-data-fetching`, `expo:eas-update` as needed,
and `frontend-design:frontend-design` for the Today/Plan screens; this skill
keeps only Tanren deltas.
